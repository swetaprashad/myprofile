<h2>Personal Information</h2>


<p>I was born in Sandringham hospital on March 16th 1999, and my background is Indian and Nepalese. My first language is English; however, I can speak fluent Hindi, moderate Nepalese and basic Italian. I learnt Hindi and Nepalese from home through my parents and Italian from primary school all the way till Year 12. 

My favourite hobby is learning languages as I am currently studying Spanish 1 this semester too as an elective!
</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>


<p>My interest in IT began from a young age when I always used to play on my dad’s computer. I was always intrigued by what seemed like this massive screen, with a keyboard in front of it that would type whatever you put on the board; it was like magic! After that I continued my passion for learning new things on the computer and eventually my dad bought me my own laptop. I learnt everything on my own from there just by using it every day and trying new things.<p>

<p>I can use Microsoft Office proficiently, Illustrator and software’s like Salesforce and Tableau. I really enjoy the impact IT has on our current world and love learning new things about it daily.<p>

<p>I chose RMIT University because of the work experience opportunities it had inbuilt within its course. I am currently a final year student studying the Bachelor of Business Marketing (Applied). All applied courses at RMIT include a one-year full time paid work placement at a major organisation; and I was really interested at the idea of having work experience whilst studying.<p>

<p>During my studies I expected to learn different Marketing platforms that would mostly be used during Campaigns and Digital Marketing.<p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<h3>Description of Ideal Job</h3>

<p>The Information Technology industry operates at a speed much faster than any other industry and for this reason, there’s always a significant demand for highly-skilled workers. This job is appealing to me because it is convenient and allows you to resolve high issues from home or the office; you do not essentially have to travel all the time to your clients’ place of residence. <p>

<h3>Skills, qualifications and experience required</h3>

<p>o	Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field.<p>
<p>o	2+ years’ experience in computer networks and systems maintenance.<p>

<h3>Skills, qualifications and experience I currently have</h3>

<p>o	Excellent written and verbal communication skills.<p>
<p>o	Good interpersonal skills.<p>
<p>o	Attention to detail.<p>
<p>o	Good problem-solving skills.<p>


<h3>Plan on how to obtain these skills</h3>

<p>After I finish my Marketing Degree, I plan on staying at RMIT to study Information Technology/Computer Systems. This will allow me to build my IT knowledge, configuration, modems and network cabling. During the course, I can build on my skills I already have such as written and verbal communication skills, interpersonal skills and problem-solving skills.<p>


<h2>3 tests on learning styles</h2>

<img src="/Documents/IT images/IPIP Big Five Factor Markers.png" alt="IPIP Big Five Factor Markers" width="1686" height="892">

<img src="/Documents/IT images/What is your learning style? .png" alt="What is your learning style?" width="1466" height="1226">

<p>These test results show me that I am an observant, extroverted and auditory learner – as I always ensure I make others feel comfortable in new situations, talk to people frequently, and learn by listening to others tell me. These learning styles will potentially affect me positively and negatively in a team because I am able to see and learn, however if someone doesn’t tell me properly to begin with and make a mistake, I can possibly take that to heart and I tend to blame myself. However, being extroverted will help me in asking questions if I don’t understand something so I avoid making mistakes. When forming a team, I need to consider all of these strengths/weaknesses I have to enable a smooth-running team.<p>


<h2>My Project Idea</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The project will be a user-friendly mobile app to provide current domestic RMIT VCE and tertiary students a transformative experience through the use of an application. PiXel is an application designed to remove student pain points by providing resources and interactive content; promoting engagement within the RMIT community. It will allow student to navigate around campus more conveniently, share their timetable with their peers, virtually interact with classmates via the social hub, chat with team members during class projects and assignments, and through the use of blocks and widgets it will help present the process of enrolling in an easier and engaging way.<p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>The reason I chose to do this project is because as a current student myself I found pain points that hindered my process in doing certain things such as limitations of enrolling, finding the right platform to collaborate and interact with fellow peers, having limited knowledge and experience in navigating around RMIT campus, low engagement with student clubs and within the student community, functionality of timetabling and transitioning into university.<p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This mobile app will provide current RMIT students a transformative experience and remove any student pain points they have. The point of difference in comparison to any other tertiary education mobile application out there is being able to respond to students needs and work collaboratively and increase engagement. Furthermore, through thorough research it was found that students find Instagram, YouTube, Spotify and LinkedIn as the top 4 easiest and most used apps.<p>



<p>The RMIT PiXel app will include the following:<p>

<p>Blocks and Widgets<p>
<p>Blocks and Widgets will help present the process of enrolling in an easier and engaging way. When students complete a step, the block will be unlocked, and the student will be able to receive coins in the process. The coins can then be used as an incentive and can be put towards student needs like printing money.<p>

<p>Project Chat<p>
<p>Project chat is designed to help students to collaborate and discuss group assignments and projects that they are working on for their course. Students will be able to search up their peers by using their student numbers.<p>

<p>Building Finder<p>
<p>Finding a building in a new environment can be difficult and confusing. Building Finder is designed to help students efficiently find buildings and rooms on campus. By sampling typing in the building number and the map will provide clear directions.<p>

<p>Social Hub<p>
<p>Inspired by the Instagram stories and Snapchat subscriptions feature, the Social Hub will help clubs and societies to inform students about what events and activities are happening on campus. This will allow different departments within RMIT such as clubs and societies to upload content. Students will get notifications based on what groups they have joined.<p>

<p>Time Connect<p>
<p>Finding time to hang out with friends can be difficult when you’re a university student. Time Connect is created to help students with planning social activities by syncing their friends’ timetable with their own. Showing free time to make planning easy and convenient.<p>

<p>Adult 101<p>
<p>Transitioning from high school to tertiary studies can be difficult. Adult 101 is designed to help students by providing resources such as the JobShop and CareerHub. How to finance, time management planners and social block (blocks social media so that the students can focus on their studies).<p>

<p>All these different features will allow a transformative and engaging experience for students to have an enjoyable and positive university experience.<p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

<p>It’s important to use the right technology and tools when creating a mobile application as it is the foundation to your successful business.<p>

<p>•	Applery is a cloud-based mobile all developer that can be used to create apps for Android or iOS. Since the builder runs in the cloud, there is nothing to install or download, and it is easy to get in.<p>

<p>•	Datadog is the monitoring, security and analytics platform mobile app developers and this will be useful because it will accelerate cyber security and automatically detects threats across dynamic cloud environments which will ensure the safety of students when interacting with peers and staff members.<p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>

<p>•	Cross platform development<p>

<p>To have the skills and knowledge to be able to create any kind of app needed or required. Especially is PiXel will be going live across Android and iOS.<p>

<p>•	UX/UI Design Skills<p>

<p>Be able to design the app and make it look slick and aesthetically appealing to consumers. User Interface skills as well as the standard app developer requirements to make sure that their apps have the best chance of selling.<p>

<p>•	Modern Programming Languages<p>

<p>Familiarity with front end development and a good understanding of modern programming languages like PHP, Java, HTML5 and C#, as well as the likes of Adobe Flash Lite, Python and Objective C will be really important when creating the app to allow a better understanding of the program.<p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>If the project is successful, RMIT students will be able to have a more accessible and positive experience in transitioning into university across all aspects such as enrolling, interacting with peers and navigating their way around campus. The original problem of student pain points will be successful as they will be removed by the implementation of the different features in the mobile app. This app will have a huge impact on the RMIT community and staff and students by allowing them to work collaboratively and increase engagement.<p>
